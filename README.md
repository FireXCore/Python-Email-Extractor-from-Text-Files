# Python Email Extractor from Text Files

## Overview
This script allows you to extract unique email addresses from `.txt` files in a specified directory. It processes each text file, finds all email addresses using regular expressions, and outputs the results to a new file with a `_emails.txt` suffix.

Notes

    The script only processes .txt files in the same directory as the script.
    All email addresses are saved in a new file with duplicates removed.
    Ensure your .txt files are encoded in UTF-8 to avoid decoding errors during processing.

Troubleshooting

    If you encounter any issues with file encoding or email extraction, ensure that your text files are properly formatted and free of special characters that might interfere with the script.
